<h1 class="h1">The case against Julius Caesar</h1>


<p class="p1">Some historians believe that Julius Caesar inadvertently burned down the Library of Alexandria during the Roman occupation of Alexandria in 48 BCE. Caesar ordered his troops to set fire to Egyptian boats in the Port of Alexandria, but the fire got out of control and spread to the library. This may be what happened, but many scholars disagree.</p>
