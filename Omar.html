<h1 class="h1">The case against the Muslim Caliph Omar</h1>


<p class="p1">It is possible that the Library of Alexandria was burned down by Omar after he conquored Alexandria in 640 CE. Omar is alleged to have said, ""the books will either contradict the Quran, in which case they are heresy, or they will agree with it, so they are superfluous".</p>
