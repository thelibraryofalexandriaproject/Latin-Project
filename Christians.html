<h1 class="h1">The case against the fifth century Christians</h1>


<p class="p1">After the death of Theodosius I, a Christian monk was publicly killed in Alexandria. Due to the ongoing unrest of the city of Alexnadria, this killing resulted in mass riots. A Christian mob killed and dragged prominent Alexandrian scholar Hypatia through the streets. It is possible that during these riots, the library was burned down.</p>
